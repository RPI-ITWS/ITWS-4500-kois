Because lab4 was too messy, I built a simple new lab5, which is a simple news management application that allows users to create, read, update and delete news items through the React interface. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, and the data is stored in MongoDB. In addition, users can also change the background color of the application by clicking a button, increasing interactivity. The entire project is designed to demonstrate how to build a full-stack application using modern web technology stacks. Since I'm not familiar with react, I didn't add too many things, but for the sake of creativity, I added the function of changing the page color.
