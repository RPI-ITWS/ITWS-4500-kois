All the frontend of the website is connected to the backend which makes it difficult to change, I tried to fix these issues but it takes a lot of time and I have 4 exams this week so I can't focus all my energy on it. So I chose to add a few things instead of rewriting, I changed the class example, like-button, I added a counter to count how many times the button was pressed, and added another new dynamic button.
