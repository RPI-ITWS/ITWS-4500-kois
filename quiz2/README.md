There was a problem connecting to MongoDB. I spent an hour and tried all the methods I recorded but couldn't figure out what the problem was, so I gave up. In order not to delay the subsequent code, I downloaded the json file and called it output.json. Because of time issues, I cropped some of the previous labs, but the json format of lab7 is different and there is not enough time, so this chart cannot be displayed.
